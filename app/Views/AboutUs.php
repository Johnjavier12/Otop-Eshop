                        <b>OTOP E-Shop Website</b> is an online one-stop shop of various OTOP
                        products offered by MSMEs in the Province of Isabela. It aims to support
                        and empower the market reach of MSMEs and their products.
                     </p>

                     <p>
                        One Town One Product Program - Rationale:
                        - OTOP Philippines is a priority stimulus program for Micro and Small and
                        Medium-scale enterprises (MSMEs) as the government’s customized
                        intervention to drive inclusive local economic growth. The program enables
                        localities and communities to determine, develop, support, and promote
                        culturally-rooted products or services where they can be the best at or best
                        renowned for.
                        <br><br>
                        - OTOP Next Gen is DTI’s program to LEVEL UP these products and services.
                        Building from the gains of OTOP first generation, this initiative aims to offer
                        a package of public-private assistance in order for MSMEs with minimum
                        viable products to come up with new or better offerings with significant
                        improvement and innovation in the areas of quality, product development,
                        design, standards compliance, marketability, production capability, brand
                        development, among others.
                        <br><br>
                        - OTOP products are identified based primarily on its (1) cultural value –
                        heritage, local customs, living traditions, or a vintage recipe passed on from
                        generations; (2) abundant resources or skills – available raw materials and a
                        pool of skills readily deployable in the locality or proximate ones; (3)
                        competitive advantage – a locality’s innate or endemic strength anchored on
                        several variables like topography, climate, geographic location, among others.
                        MSMEs who engage in business within the value chain of OTOP products
                        (raw material suppliers, processing, distributor, retailer, but mostly the
                        manufacturers, etc).

                     <p>
                        <b>What are MSMEs?</b><br>

                        It has always been the DTI’s priority to help future and budding entrepreneurs
                        in visualizing and expanding their business, respectively. We are there, every
                        step of the way, helping owners of micro-, small-, and medium-sized
                        enterprises (MSMEs) start their trade through the conceptualization phase and
                        walk them through the registration process.
                        <br><br>
                        - Every year, we have a series of events and trainings lined up to help MSME
                        owners and aspiring entrepreneurs make the most out of their ventures.
                        - In addition, you can find on the site itself a host of resources which can guide
                        you in your venture, such as laws, relevant links, the MSMED Plan,
                        publications and statistics.
                        <br><br>
                        - As entrepreneurs expand, we share with the available financing options, patent
                        application guides, market development services, and product development
                        and export assistance. You can find a local Negosyo Center to help you with
                        business registration and facilitate access to business services, among others.
                        <br><br>
                        - In an unfortunate case where you need to end your business, we provide you
                        with the requirements to properly do so.
